# 🧭 React Landing Page

A landing page built with React and Bootstrap, created as part of my Bootcamo. This project demonstrates the use of functional components to organize the interface in a modular, reusable, and scalable way.

## 🚀 Project Description

This exercise involves building a landing page using **React** and functional components. The main goal is to learn how to **identify and break down the UI into reusable components**, following best practices for clean and maintainable code.

The page includes:

- A navigation bar (`<Navbar />`)
- A jumbotron-style header (`<Hero />`)
- Four informational cards (`<Card />`)
- A footer (`<Footer />`)

All components are imported and assembled in the main `App.jsx` component.
